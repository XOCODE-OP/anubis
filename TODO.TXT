//TODO:



//remember address via storage
//multiple addresses
//sample addresses
// local storage
// sort by value
// by changing the currency to eth and btc in coingecko request for prices, we can add a valuations in eth and btc, and I think thats worth it

add metamask connector for pasting address (and then use metamask instead of infura?)

add a sort of console visually on screen because shit takes a long time

/*
Right now, we just poll from "All token" (whitelist).<br />
I think the obvious real approach would be, to look at the transaction history of an 
address and from that, determine all tokens the address might have, instead of guessing. Especially 
since every guess is a node/infura request and also slow.

after etherscan, or rather after white list is done,
create divs from that
fetch all infure balances simultaneously 
then async inject infura balance into the divs
calculate usd by multiply with coingecko markets price.
IF that is non existant then query coingecko with slow

somehow callback to calc the total
