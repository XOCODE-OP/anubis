//TODO:


//sample addresses

Done needs testing:
//remember address via storage
// local storage

//multiple addresses

> instead of saying on the console that a symbol is not supported, make a div for it saying it on the UI, different class
> add metamask connector for pasting address (and then use metamask instead of infura?)



/*
Right now, we just poll from "All token" (whitelist).<br />
I think the obvious real approach would be, to look at the transaction history of an 
address and from that, determine all tokens the address might have, instead of guessing. Especially 
since every guess is a node/infura request and also slow.

Poll markets from coingecko

this is sorted by marketcap, contains prices and icons.
in order go through and poll the balances.
contracts addresses can be found in the uniswap list (all_tokens)

after etherscan, or rather after white list is done,
create divs from that
fetch all infure balances simultaneously 
then async inject infura balance into the divs
calculate usd by multiply with coingecko markets price.
IF that is non existant then query coingecko with slow

somehow callback to calc the total
