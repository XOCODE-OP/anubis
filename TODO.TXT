> PROBLEMS:
uniswap broken?
uniswap token is broken, it takes universe whatever prie. reason is that the UNI symbol exists many times on the coingecko id list.
also, we poll every token contra addr from every eth addr. we dont distinquish which token came in from with eth addr.
so we are wasting time and juice.
